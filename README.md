# What is your motivation for building this app? Who is it for?

Our web app is used for rating textbooks and identifying if a textbook is actually
necessary to purchase for a given course. Often times, professors have a list of
textbooks that will be used in the course. However, there have been many
circumstances where the textbook is rarely used and referenced to learn the material.
Most of the time, courses have PowerPoint slides and/or PDFs that give the student all
the material necessary to perform well. This means that many Rutgers students who
have bought textbooks potentially wasted hundreds to thousands of dollars
throughout their college years. The reviews and recommendations given by our web app could help students
avoid paying for textbooks that they will not use and provide feedback on the usefulness
of the textbook for their courses.
